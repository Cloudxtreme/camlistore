This is a Go package which maps (lat, long) to a timezone.

The motivation is figuring out the UTC time of a JPG with EXIF
metadata containing GPS coordinates and local time, but no timezone
offset. This is a surprising number of photos.

See docs at http://godoc.org/github.com/bradfitz/latlong

To rebuild the data files, see the Makefile (or just run Make).
You'll need the data files unzip to the "world" directory.
